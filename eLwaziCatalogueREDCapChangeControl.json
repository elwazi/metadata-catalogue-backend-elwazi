        "description": "A new variable was added to replace the d_category variable which was a single select field for indicating the data types in a dataset (in the instrument Dataset Metadata). The new variable d_category_1 is a multi-select choicebox field (in the instrument Dataset Metadata) and allows users to select multiple data types for a single dataset. Some additional variables p_website; storage_link; listed below were modified from required to optional fields and variables (g_organism; g_method; g_design; i_organism) were recoded to accommodate standardised coding for ‘Other’. The branching logic, which displays fields based on category selected, was modified to reference the new or modified variables."
